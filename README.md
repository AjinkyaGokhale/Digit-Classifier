# Digit-Classifier
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Digit Classifier project!

This project is a machine learning model that is able to classify handwritten digits. 
The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

The model is implemented using the Keras library, which is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models. 
It is built using the TensorFlow backend, which is a powerful open-source platform for machine learning.

To use the model, simply clone the repository and run the digits_recognition_neural_network.ipynb script. 
The script will automatically download the MNIST dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance. 
You can then use the model to classify your own handwritten digits by passing in an image as input.

I hope that this project will be a valuable learning resource for anyone interested in machine learning and image classification. 
Please feel free to browse the code and use it as a starting point for your own projects. 
If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting, and happy coding!
